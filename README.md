## Overview
Loughborough Library is a simple library book management system built primarily in python with the use of the Tkinter GUI library. The system allows users to search for books either by title of by category/genre. Additionally, books can be loaned out and returned to the library. The user can keep track of books that are out on loan or overdue. Users can also view analytics relating to book usage in the library (for instance the user can view the most popular genres or the number of books loaned out per year). This project was originally a coursework assignment for the Introduction to Programming module in [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/)'s undergraduate Computer Science [course](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/computer-science-bsc/).
